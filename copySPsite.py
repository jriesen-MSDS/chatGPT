This script uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET 
request to the SharePoint 2013 site's REST API. It first 
authenticates to the site using the site URL, username, 
and password, and then retrieves the site data using the
"web" API call. It then saves the site data to a local 
file named "site_data.xml".

Once you have downloaded the SharePoint 2013 site data,
you can use the same script from my previous answer to 
upload the site data to the SharePoint 2016 site. However, 
keep in mind that this may not preserve all site customizations
or configurations, and you may need to manually update or 
configure the SharePoint 2016 site after the upload.
