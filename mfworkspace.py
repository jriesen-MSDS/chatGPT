Reflection Workspace using external libraries. One approach is to use a library like 'py3270' (for IBM mainframes) or 'pyte' (for generic terminal emulation) to establish a connection with the host system and perform actions like navigating through screens or sending commands.

Here is a simple example using 'py3270' to connect to a mainframe, log in, navigate to a specific account, and capture the screen
